# Music Sales App
* This is an app I built during an internship with the company Vista Health between January - June 2024.
<br/><br/>
* **The app was developed for (and in conjunction with) a large blue chip pharmaceutical company in order to display their global sales information.**
<br/><br/>
* I built the frontend of this app completeley independently using VanillaJS and Chart.js charting library. (It was the preference of Vista Health that I used VanillaJS to create the app).
<br/><br/>
* The backend of the application was created by another team member using Amazon AWS.
<br/><br/>

* **This application was designed to be viewed on desktop – due to the complex graphical data it displays.** (Although it is possible to view it on mobile – the user may not be able to see the data clearly on small devices).
  <br/><br/>
* PLEASE NOTE – The data that is displayed in the current version of this application is fictitious. The app has been repurposed to display music sales data, due to the confidential nature of the data that was initially displayed.

# The features of the app include:
* Dropdown menu to browse all the artists in the database
* Information on the artist’s record company, style and last release date.
<br/><br/><br/>
## Market Data View
When the ‘Market data’ (purple) button is highlighted, the app shows sales data for each artist for the years 2021, 2022 and the 2023 Volume is forecasted.
<br/><br/>
*	Data can be viewed for:
*	(i) Sales Volume
*	(ii) Sales Value
*	(iii) Average Selling Price
<br/><br/>
## Regions
As this app is designed to display global sales data, each graph shows data for four geographical regions:
* AAA (Asia, Australia and Africa).
* Europe
* Latin America
* North America
<br/><br/>
The data can also be viewed by different music format (individually or combined), these are:
* (i) Downloads
* (ii) CDs
* (iii) Vinyl
  <br/><br/>
## Graph Features
* The graphs are animated and display different information depending on what buttons are selected
* The graphs have a hover function which show the sales statistics of each coloured graph bar on hover.
* The CAGR % (Compound Annual Growth Rate) lines were added at the client’s request.
* These are animated and are ‘redrawn’ based on what buttons are selected.
* There is also a dynamic ‘key’ displayed in the bottom right hand corner – which changes depending on what information is displayed on the graph.
   <br/><br/>
## Charts
* When each graph is clicked the same sales information is displayed in chart form (for a more detailed breakdown).
* The CAGR % can also be viewed in the charts.
   <br/><br/>
## Tutorial
* The application includes a tutorial which assists users in navigating and using the app.
   <br/><br/>
## Product Recommendations View
* When the ‘Purple Recommendations’ (purple) button is highlighted, examples of the artist’s music is displayed, as well as recommendations (and links to) streaming services that are given based on the sales information of the individual artist selected.

***
## Potential Improvements
* This application is a work in progress and there are some improvments that I would like to make in the future:
* Refactor the code to make it more readable - this code was produced quickly to accommodate client deadlines. Refactoring it would make it more readable.
* Restyling the front end - this app was styled based on client specifications. I would prefer to restyle to app in the future to make it more attractive and improve accessibility.
* Spend more time improving the app for mobile - to more easily view the complex graphical data on mobile devices.
