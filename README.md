# Music Sales App
* This is an app I built during an internship with the company Vista Health between January - June 2024.
<br/><br/>
* **The app was developed for (and in conjunction with) a large blue chip pharmaceutical company in order to display their global sales information.**
<br/><br/>
* I built the frontend of this app completeley independently using VanillaJS and Chart.js charting library. (It was the preference of Vista Health that I used VanillaJS to create the app).
<br/><br/>
* The backend of the application was created by another team member using Amazon AWS.
<br/><br/>

* **This application was designed to be viewed on desktop – due to the complex graphical data it displays.** (Although it is possible to view it on mobile – the user may not be able to see the data clearly on small devices).
  <br/><br/>
* PLEASE NOTE – The data that is displayed in the current version of this application is fictitious. The app has been repurposed to display music sales data, due to the confidential nature of the data that was initially displayed.
